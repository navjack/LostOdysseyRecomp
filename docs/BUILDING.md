# Building and running

[Overview](../README.md) · [Current status](STATUS.md)

## Prerequisites

The tested environment is Windows x64 with Direct3D 12 or the optional Vulkan backend, Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools and Windows SDK, LLVM clang-cl, CMake 3.28+, Ninja and Python 3.11+ (the code-generation guard uses the standard-library `tomllib` module). The runtime requires Clang; the `windows-msvc` preset is not a supported runtime alternative. Generated code uses AVX instructions. Windows 10 1803+ is required by the current memory-mapping path; this is not a guarantee for every GPU/driver combination.

The scripts [build_runtime.bat](../tools/build_runtime.bat), [build_tools.bat](../tools/build_tools.bat) and [CMakePresets.json](../CMakePresets.json) discover Visual Studio with `vswhere` and resolve tools from `PATH`. Use `LO_VCVARS64` or `LLVM_ROOT` for custom installations. Keep personal overrides in the ignored `CMakeUserPresets.json`.

## Game data and dependencies

1. Supply your own extracted Asian multilingual edition, matching the [XEX details](notes/xex.md). Place Disc 1 at `LostOdysseyRecompLib/private/disc1/`, including `default.xex`, `LO.fpi` and its resource archives. Four-disc integration is not complete.
2. Initialize submodules and apply the [project patches](../tools/patches/README.md). Do not reapply patches over a modified dependency tree.
3. Build the generator tools, then generate local PowerPC sources. Generated code and game data are ignored by Git.

From the repository root, after preparing dependencies and data:

```powershell
.\tools\build_tools.bat
python -B tools/ppc_codegen.py generate
.\tools\build_runtime.bat
```

`build_tools.bat` builds the generator and records a receipt containing the generator binary and source hashes. `ppc_codegen.py generate` verifies that receipt, hashes the TOML and generator inputs before and after execution, writes an output manifest for the generated C++/header files and rejects obsolete 64-bit jump-table switches. Use `python -B tools/ppc_codegen.py check` to verify an existing generated tree without regenerating it; if the inputs or outputs changed, regenerate from the repository root. Configured runtime builds also run `LoPpcCodegenCheck` as an order dependency before compiling guest objects. See [recompilation notes](notes/recomp.md) for function boundaries and switch-table maintenance. These commands describe the checked-in scripts; a new-machine end-to-end bootstrap has not been retested as part of this documentation update.

### Optional PPC prebuilt library

Release packaging uses a PPC static library restored from the private immutable
`ppc/<key>` branch selected by the input/compiler key. The XEX input remains
from its pinned private commit and is checked against its pinned SHA256. Local builds can opt into the same path by
restoring the bundle into an ignored output directory and setting
`LO_PREBUILT_PPC_DIR`; CMake checks the existing generated tree, then consumes
`LostOdysseyRecompLib.lib` and skips compiling generated PPC C++ sources. The
release workflow runs its separate `Generate game code` step before this CMake
configuration. Clear the variable to return to the ordinary generated-source build.

From `cmd` or an x64 Developer Command Prompt, keep the compiler environment in
the same shell before running the exporter:

```cmd
call tools\setup_windows.bat
python tools\release\ppc_prebuilt.py export --build-dir out\build\fps-0.5.4 --output out\ppc-export
```

The export/restore commands above are retained for offline bundle diagnostics.
The current upload path is the post-build auto-sync hook or
`ppc_sync.py sync`, which selects an immutable `ppc/<key>` branch.

Then restore and check the fresh export from PowerShell:

```powershell
python tools/release/ppc_prebuilt.py restore --bundle out/ppc-export --output out/ppc-prebuilt
python tools/release/ppc_prebuilt.py check --bundle out/ppc-prebuilt --build-dir out/build/fps-0.5.4
```

For a local prebuilt runtime build in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:LO_PREBUILT_PPC_DIR = (Resolve-Path out/ppc-prebuilt).Path
.\tools\build_release.bat
Remove-Item Env:LO_PREBUILT_PPC_DIR
```

The release contract is x64 clang-cl, Release, static CRT (`/MT`) and non-LTO.
Preserve codegen receipts, input/output and CMake hashes, compile flags/includes,
shard hashes and library SHA256 as evidence. The 13 synthetic bundle checks pass;
the local Release/x64 clang-cl export, restore and isolated prebuilt CMake check
also pass. The complete runtime was inspected through its Ninja dependency/link
graph and has zero PPC compile commands while referencing the imported library;
the runtime was not relinked or launched. See the [release packaging evidence](notes/release-packaging.md).

### Local PPC auto-sync

Local builds may opt into post-build PPC synchronization only after enabling the
local Git setting with `git config --local lo.ppcAutoSync true`. The CMake option
reads that setting; if an existing cache is `OFF`, reconfigure with
`-DLO_PPC_AUTO_SYNC=ON` as needed, while `OFF` disables the hook. CMake alone does
not grant the script's upload authorization. The hook runs only after a
successful PPC library build and invokes `ppc_sync.py sync --already-built`. It
is not a file watcher, and editing files does not trigger it.

The sync key covers PPC inputs and compiler arguments. If the same key already
exists remotely, no compilation or upload occurs. A changed key uses a new
immutable private `ppc/<key>` branch with dynamically sized shards of at most
40 MiB; old branches are
retained. Imported libraries, CI and `LO_PPC_SYNC_ACTIVE` are excluded from
uploads. Sync failures report a build or retry failure and do not silently fall
back. For a manual run, prepare the Windows environment in one `cmd` session:

```cmd
call tools\setup_windows.bat
python tools\release\ppc_sync.py sync --build-dir out\build\fps-0.5.4
```

Non-Release builds may create the independent `out/build/ppc-sync-Release`
configuration and build only its Release PPC library; that configuration keeps
the hook off to prevent recursion. The read-only key command accepts
`--build-dir DIR [--github-output PATH]`; `--force` enables one manual sync and
`--already-built` is reserved for the internal hook.

Nineteen synthetic sync cases pass. Separately, the built-library roundtrip and
change-during-build cases pass. The real `LoPpcAutoSync` target, same-key unchanged
check and sparse restore/check also pass; the target produced no PPC C++ compile
commands and did not build or launch the runtime. See the [release packaging
evidence](notes/release-packaging.md) for the branch, commit and retained logs.

Audio configuration fetches the pinned Xenia FFmpeg source via CMake FetchContent, so first configuration needs network access. See [ffmpeg.cmake](../thirdparty/ffmpeg.cmake) and its [license](../thirdparty/ffmpeg-LICENSE.txt). This is a frame-level XMAFRAMES decoder, not a system FFmpeg executable requirement.

Release builds do not require a separately installed Vulkan SDK. Windows Vulkan headers, volk and VMA come from the patched plume submodule; the GPU driver supplies `vulkan-1.dll` and its ICD. The runtime requests Vulkan 1.2, buffer-device-address, geometry shaders and Win32 WSI. Use the exact paired DXC v1.8.2407 DLLs copied by CMake and tracked in [DXC provenance](../thirdparty/dxc-licenses/PROVENANCE.json); do not substitute one DLL independently. Building the runtime also builds `LostOdysseyUpdater` in the same output directory, which the package step expects.

## Building on Linux

Building the native Linux ELF works on Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu or Manjaro) or under WSL2.

### Linux host prerequisites

- Clang / Clang++ (LLVM toolchain)
- Ninja
- CMake 3.28+
- Python 3.11+ (needs standard-library `tomllib`)
- Vulkan loader and Mesa (or another Vulkan ICD compatible with your hardware)
- Typical C++ build development packages
- Running `vulkaninfo` is useful for verifying your driver setup, though not strictly required by CMake

SDL2 build dependencies are already vendored in the repository tree.

### Linux PowerPC source generation

Linux compiles generated PowerPC source code directly from `LostOdysseyRecompLib/ppc/`. The Windows prebuilt static library is not used on Linux.

If `LostOdysseyRecompLib/ppc/` is empty or missing, generate the sources from the repository root:

```bash
# Build XenonRecomp generator tools if not already present
cmake -B out/tools -S tools/XenonRecomp -G Ninja
cmake --build out/tools

# Generate PowerPC sources
python3 -B tools/ppc_codegen.py generate
```

### Configure and build

Configure and compile using the `linux-clang` preset:

```bash
cmake --preset linux-clang
cmake --build --preset linux-clang
```

The resulting executable is written to:

```bash
out/build/linux-clang/LostOdysseyRecomp/LostOdysseyRecomp
```

### DXC shared library on Linux

CMake automatically copies the Linux DXC shared library from `tools/XenosRecomp/thirdparty/dxc-bin/lib/x64/libdxcompiler.so` into the output folder next to the `LostOdysseyRecomp` ELF during build. If you need a custom DXC location, set the `LO_DXC_PATH` environment variable before running.

## Launch with a consistent working directory

```powershell
$gameData = (Resolve-Path .\LostOdysseyRecompLib\private\disc1).Path
Push-Location .\out\build\windows-clang\LostOdysseyRecomp
.\LostOdysseyRecomp.exe --game $gameData --quiet-kernel
Pop-Location
```

With explicit `--game`, `save/`, `profile/`, `cache/` and default `logs/` remain relative to the
process working directory, allowing isolated regression runs. Launching without `--game`
first selects the executable directory, then resolves `game-path.txt` or the adjacent `game`
folder. A fresh installation opens initial settings before guest startup. `LO_PROFILE_DIR`
overrides the profile location. Back up saves before testing; use independent save/profile copies.

When launching with `--game`, start from the ELF's directory. Explicit game candidates skip the
executable-directory `chdir`, so the working directory controls relative saves, profiles, caches
and logs.

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LO_LOG_FILE=<path>` | Append logs to a selected file; `0` disables the duplicate file sink. Default: a separate timestamped file under `logs/`. |
| `LO_BACKGROUND=1` | Hidden rendering window; background audio is muted by default. |
| `LO_DEBUG_MENU_OPEN=1` | Open the Windows debug panel at startup for UI validation; default is closed. |
| `LO_HEADLESS=1` | No video device/window; not equivalent to hidden rendering. |
| `LO_AUDIO_MUTE=1` | Mute device output. |
| `LO_AUDIO_CAPTURE=<path>` | Up to 60 seconds of raw 48kHz stereo float PCM before mute. |
| `LO_CONTROLLER_RUMBLE=1` | Enable controller rumble; default is off. |
| `LO_GRAPHICS_API=d3d12\|vulkan` | Override the persisted `graphics_backend` choice for one launch; unset/`auto` uses the saved choice. |

Clear test-only environment variables before manual play. Do not treat a window staying open, a heartbeat, or nonzero PCM as proof a scene is correct.

The shader compiler uses the paired `dxcompiler.dll`/`dxil.dll` copied beside the runtime. Custom development builds must preserve the v1.8.2407 pair and its license/provenance checks; the Windows SDK fallback is not the tested packaging contract.

Generated baseline mappings, branch targets, import listings and Ghidra exports are local analysis artifacts. They are ignored; regenerate them from your own data when extending the recompiler configuration. Checked-in TOML and manual boundary/switch overrides remain the build inputs.

## Verification

Use `tools\test.bat --list` to select checks, then run only the relevant suites, for example `tools\test.bat shaders pipeline`. Runtime suites use an existing CMake build root (`--build-dir out/build/release` by default), with their target built explicitly; the runner does not implicitly build the game. See the [test guide](../tools/tests/README.md) for per-suite build commands, prerequisites and CI separation.

[Rendering tests](notes/rendering-validation.md) cover memory aliases, shader ALU, stencil and texture layout. [Audio notes](notes/audio-output.md) cover `LoXmaLoopTest`; [storage notes](notes/save-storage.md) describe `LoStorageTest`. Some investigation targets and input hooks remain local changes; consult [status](STATUS.md) before expecting them in a clean checkout.

The [selected native targets](../tools/tests/README.md#selected-native-targets) are excluded from the default build. Build only the target needed for the change, for example `cmake --build out/build/release --target LoVulkanBackendTest`, then run it explicitly. Vulkan fixtures use the installed driver's loader and an isolated working directory; they do not establish broad GPU compatibility or gameplay correctness. The updater helper and probe targets are host-side checks and do not require guest generation.
